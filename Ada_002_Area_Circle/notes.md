-- I think the hardest time sometimes in coding is when there are errors that are not suited to the tarjec project
-- Like this: Project file has error and can't be loaded.
-- If I use only Ada for learning I need to see this red shit on my desktop!
-- Uff I know I should handle the error and shut up!
-- In this part I remember I handled a different behaviour:
-- The numbers are structured with the * (-10) method to have more precision in the output
-- If you don't mind about details like this Ada it is not for you!
